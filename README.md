This my current Opencore EFI to boot macOS Sonoma on the Dell Latitude 5511. 

Note that I have a Intel 8265 / 8275 (rev 78) wifi and bluetooth card. Your laptop may have a different intel model and might work.

You will have to generate you own SMBIOS serial using Opencore Configurator or something similar.

Good luck!
